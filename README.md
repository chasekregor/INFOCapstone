# MoviRec

## Creating Movie Recommendations With Machine Learning

### Objective

MoviRec is the capstone project for Chase Kregor's B.S. in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

A great way to display technical capabilities is to show skills in Machine Learning. The ability to project peopleâ€™s future preferences is extremely valuable. Considering everyone and the layman loves movies, why not build a great movie recommender?

### Data

I am using the [MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/), it is considered on of the most robust movie rating datasets of all time and is maintained by GroupLens, which is a research lab in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

- Loading the Data
- Building the ML Models
  - Results
- Building the Flask Website
- Hosting Flask Website

### Results & Presentation

##### Results:
Project has very hard but very rewarding.

##### Presentation:
I presented my capstone at the annual INFO showcase. The link to the video can be found here.

### Next Steps & Future Work

Model optimization.

### Reproducibility

Downloading the MovieLense dataset and loading it onto a single computer can be very difficult. On top of this github has a file upload limit which stops me from being able to upload the dataset that I used. If you want to download the CSV I used go to the link in the data folder.

- 1. Git clone https://github.com/chasekregor/INFOCapstone.git
- 2. Download the dataset at link.com and put CSV into the data folder within the repository.
- 3. Run create_model.ipynb
- 4. Navigate to flask-app folder and run app.py. The website should be served at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
